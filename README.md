# Kth-Largest-Factor-of-n-Codevita
This repository contains the code for the TCS Codevita question "Kth Largest Factor of n".

A positive integer d is said to be a factor of another positive integer N if when N is divided by d, the remainder obtained is zero. For example, for number 12, there are 6 factors 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. Every positive integer k has at least two factors, 1 and the number k itself.Given two positive integers N and k, write a program to print the kth largest factor of N.

# Input Format: 

The input is a comma-separated list of positive integer pairs (N, k).

# Output Format: 

The kth highest factor of N. If N does not have k factors, the output should be 1.

# Constraints:

1<N<10000000000
1<k<600.
You can assume that N will have no prime factors which are larger than 13.

# Example 1

Input: 12,3
Output: 4
Explanation: N is 12, k is 3. The factors of 12 are (1,2,3,4,6,12). The highest factor is 12 and the third largest factor is 4. The output must be 4.

# Example 2

Input: 30,9
Output: 1
Explanation: N is 30, k is 9. The factors of 30 are (1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30). There are only 8 factors. As k is more than the number of factors, the output is 1.
